# CEI Blog Application using a dotnetcore blog API

This blog app is a follow up on a realistic usage of dotnetcore outside of a Hello World application or tutorial. It's a proof of concept that Computer Enterprises Inc can present. More info on the dotnetcore API can be found here: https://github.com/swhook52/dotnetcore-blog.

### Cross Platform Creation

Currently, the blog app is coded and created in the most up-to-date versions of Nativescript (3.0.0) and Angular (4.0.0). This is to create a cross platform usage for the blog, though development is focused moreso on Android.
